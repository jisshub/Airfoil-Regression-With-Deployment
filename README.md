# Airfoil-Regression-With-Deployment

## Airfoil Self Noise Prediction Using Linear Regression Approach

### Description

This project attempts to predict the scaled sound pressure levels in decibels, based on the aerodynamic and acoustic related attributes. Each attribute can be regarded as a potential feature. The problem is how to predict the sound pressure level accurately based on those features.
